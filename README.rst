GitHub Trac Ticket Import
=========================

Simple script for transferring tickets from Trac to GitHub.

This was written manly for a once off conversion, so this is not well tested or
supported in any way.

``TRAC_URL``
    should be pointed the CSV version of report 1. 
``USERNAME``
    is your GitHub login.
``ORGNAME``
    is the organization name where the repo is located, if different than your 
    GitHub login. (You must have appropriate permissions in the organization to
    import issues, if the organization is different than your GitHub login.) If
    left empty, then this will default to your GitHub login.
``PROJECT``
    the repo name.
``AUTH_TOKEN``
    your GitHub API token.

Known issues
------------

This code does not respect the rate limiting GitHub has on it's API, thus it
will fail once this limit has been passed.
